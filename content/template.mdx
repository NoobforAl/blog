# Your Post Title Here

Write your introduction paragraph here. This is where you introduce the topic and hook your readers.

## Section 1: Getting Started

This is a section with some content. You can write paragraphs, add lists, and include code examples.

### Subsection

You can create subsections as needed.

- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3

## Section 2: Code Examples

Here's an example of inline code: `const example = "Hello World"`.

And here's a code block with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function example() {
  console.log("Hello World");
  return true;
}
```

```typescript
interface Example {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const user: Example = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};
```

```bash
npm install package-name
npm run dev
```

## Section 3: More Content

You can add **bold text**, *italic text*, and [links](https://example.com).

![Alt text for image](/images/blog/your-image.png)
