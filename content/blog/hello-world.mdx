# Hello World: A Journey Through C and Assembly

Every language we want to start, we greet the world with a machine. A machine that today is connected to the whole world and without any obligation gives all its power to us so we can create. Like the creator who created us, to infinity.

In this first blog post, I'm writing "Hello World" with C and Assembly—the foundational languages that bring us closer to the machine itself.

## The Philosophy of Hello World

"Hello World" is more than just a simple program. It's a tradition, a rite of passage, and a bridge between human thought and machine execution. When we write our first program, we're not just outputting text—we're establishing a connection with the computer, learning its language, and beginning our journey of creation.

## Hello World in C


```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Breaking It Down

- `#include <stdio.h>` - This includes the Standard Input/Output library, which provides the `printf` function
- `int main()` - The entry point of every C program. It returns an integer (0 typically means success)
- `printf("Hello, World!\n")` - Prints our greeting to the console. The `\n` is a newline character
- `return 0` - Indicates successful program execution


## Hello World in Assembly


```asm
section .data
    msg db 'Hello, World!', 0xA    ; message with newline
    len equ $ - msg                 ; length of message

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; write syscall
    mov rax, 1          ; sys_write
    mov rdi, 1          ; stdout
    mov rsi, msg        ; message address
    mov rdx, len        ; message length
    syscall             ; invoke kernel

    ; exit syscall
    mov rax, 60         ; sys_exit
    mov rdi, 0          ; exit code
    syscall             ; invoke kernel
```

### Understanding Assembly

- `.data` section - Contains initialized data (our message)
- `.text` section - Contains the executable code
- `_start` - The entry point (equivalent to `main` in C)
- System calls - Direct communication with the operating system kernel
  - `sys_write` (1) - Writes to a file descriptor (1 = stdout)
  - `sys_exit` (60) - Terminates the program

### Assembling and Linking

```bash
nasm -f elf64 hello.asm -o hello.o
ld hello.o -o hello
./hello
```
